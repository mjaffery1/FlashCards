**Major hurdles:**

I struggled with manipulating the DOM to make the game look how I wanted. 

I had CSS properties on my stylesheet that were actually preventing me from making my game look how I wanted it to. 

I also had issues with the way I created the divs in my HTML. 

I was not doing it in a clean way so that also prevented me from creating elements and rendering them where I wanted them to be.
