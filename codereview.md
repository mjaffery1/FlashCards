Setup and Overview ( 2-5 minutes )

What was the project you were trying to build, in your own words?

- Build a flashcard app that imitated a live flash card lesson. Make features such as flipping the flash card and not being able to go to the next card without going through the present card.   


How did you break the problem down in to smaller parts?

- First I built out the layout. Then I created the questions and the answers. I found resources to help me animate the card flipping. I also started with a wireframe. 

What were the key features of your MVP? Why?

- Some of my MVP goals were having at least 10 questions, having the card flipping animation, multiple choice answers.

What was the biggest challenge you faced working on this project?

- Manipulating the DOM. Making things appear in the page the way I wanted to. 

Problem Solution ( 2-5 minutes )

What is the overall architecture or structure of your code base?

- First, I declared all my variables. Then, I listed all my questions and answers. Then, I created all my functions.

What are the key classes/functions? Why did you decide on these? What is each one doing?

- The main container that includes the flashcards. The questions and answers classes. The key function was also to grab a random question to display on the flashcard.

What pieces of functionality are missing or incomplete in your project? What are the next steps to finishing them?

- I'm not able to add more questions and my reset button only refreshes the page. I would also like to add a score counter.

Bugs and Tweaks ( 2-5 minutes )

Are there any bugs still in the project? What might be causing them? How might they be fixed?

- Once all the functions are done, the app doesn't reset. User will have to press the reset button that refreshes the page.

Are there parts of the code base that could be cleaned up so that they're easier to read and understand what is happening?

- There are functions that i didn't create a name for. I could give them a name and clean up the code.

Are there pieces of commented-out code or console.logs left in the codebase?
